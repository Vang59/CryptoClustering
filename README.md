# CryptoClustering
 This exercise focus on unsupervised learning to predict if crytocurrencies are affect by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. The use of Python, Pandas, and Sklearn to create DataFrames and visualization helps determine this prediction. 

### Scaled Data
1. Prepare the data by normalzing the CSV file using the `StandardScaler()` from `scikit-learn`.
2. Find the best value for `k` by using the `orignal scaled DataFrame` and `Elbow Method`. 
3. Predict clusters to group the crypotocurrencies using the `original DataFrame` and `K-means model`.

### PCA Data
4. Optimize clusters with `Principal Component Analysis (PCA)`.
5. Find the best value for `k` by using the `PCA DataFrame` and `Elbow Method`.
6. Predict clusters to group the crypotocurrencies using the `PCA DataFrame` and `K-means model`.
